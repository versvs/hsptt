The sun was still under the horizon and the beach was lit with a strange blue light, both dark and bright at the same time. It was very beautiful and calm. Even the waves seemed to be breaking more quietly than usual.</p></div></div><div class="su-col-edge-4"><div class="su-box"><p>Maybe this stands up to repeating. On the Monday of my second week, I saw bugs struggling to fit a swinging door on the entrance to one of the storeroom huts. He was having trouble because he only had two hands, and he needed three: two to keep the door in place and a third to hammer a peg into the hinge. I watched him do this for a while, wondering whether to offer any help, and as I began walking over the hammer slipped from his grip. Instinctively, he moved to catch it, and the door also fell, bashing against his leg.</p></div></div></div><div class="su-row"><div class="su-box"><hr></div></div><div class="su-row"><div class="su-col-edge-1"><div class="su-box"><p>He that</p></div></div></div><div class="su-row"><div class="su-col-1 su-empty-edge-1"><div class="su-box"><p>will not</p></div></div></div><div class="su-row"><div class="su-col-1 su-empty-edge-2"><div class="su-box"><p>when he may,</p></div></div></div><div class="su-row"><div class="su-col-1 su-empty-edge-3"><div class="su-box"><p>when he,</p></div></div></div><div class="su-row"><div class="su-col-1 su-empty-edge-4"><div class="su-box"><p>will he</p></div></div></div><div class="su-row"><div class="su-col-1 su-empty-edge-5"><div class="su-box"><p>shall have nay.</p></div></div></div><div class="su-row"><div class="su-box"><hr></div></div><div class="su-row"><div class="su-col-edge-2"><div class="su-box"><p>The bar-room was now full of the boarders who had been dropping in the night previous, and whom I had not as yet had a good look at. They were nearly all whalemen; chief mates, and second mates, and third mates, and sea carpenters, and sea coopers, and sea blacksmiths, and harpooneers, and ship keepers; a brown and brawny company, with bosky beards; an unshorn, shaggy set, all wearing monkey jackets for morning gowns.</p></div></div><div class="su-col-1"><div class="su-box"><p>After examining one by one the different theories, rejecting all other suggestions, it becomes necessary to admit the existence of a marine animal of enormous power.</p></div></div><div class="su-col-1"><div class="su-box"><p>I was surprised at the coolness with which John avowed his knowledge of the island, and I own I was half-frightened when I saw him drawing nearer to myself.</p></div></div><div class="su-col-edge-2"><div class="su-box"><p>What a pursuit! No, I cannot describe the emotion that vibrated through me. Ned Land kept his post, harpoon in hand. Several times the animal let us gain upon it. â€” "We shall catch it! we shall catch it!" cried the Canadian. But just as he was going to strike, the cetacean stole away with a rapidity that could not be estimated at less than thirty miles an hour, and even during our maximum of speed, it bullied the frigate, going round and round it. A cry of fury broke from everyone!</p></div></div></div><div class="su-row"><div class="su-box"><hr></div></div><div class="su-row"><div class="su-col-edge-1"><div class="su-box"><p>No one took notice of me, only the bow oar saying, "Is that you, Jim? Keep your head down." But Silver, from the other boat, looked sharply over and called out to know if that were me; and from that moment I began to regret what I had done.</p></div></div><div class="su-col-1"><div class="su-box"><p>Near one o'clock in the morning, I was seized with dreadful fatigue. My limbs stiffened under the strain of violent cramp. Conseil was obliged to keep me up, and our preservation devolved on him alone.</p></div></div><div class="su-col-1 su-empty-2"><div class="su-box"><p>At last the speakers seemed to have paused and perhaps to have sat down, for not only did they cease to draw any nearer, but the birds themselves began to grow more quiet and to settle again to their places in the swamp.</p></div></div></div><div class="su-row"><div class="su-box"><hr></div></div><div class="su-row"><div class="su-col-edge-3"><div class="su-box"><p>After some minutes, a loud hissing was heard. I felt the cold mount from my feet to my chest. Evidently from some part of the vessel they had, by means of a tap, given entrance to the water, which was invading us, and with which the room was soon filled. A second door cut in the side of the Nautilus then opened. We saw a faint light. In another instant our feet trod the bottom of the sea.</p></div></div><div class="su-col-edge-3"><div class="su-box"><p>All this time no one prolonged his voluntary task beyond the prescribed time. His task accomplished, each one handed in turn to his panting companions the apparatus that supplied him with life. Captain Nemo set the example, and submitted first to this severe discipline. When the time came, he gave up his apparatus to another and returned to the vitiated air on board, calm, unflinching, unmurmuring.</p></div></div></div><div class="su-row"><div class="su-box"><hr></div></div><div class="su-row"><div class="su-col-4 su-empty-edge-1"><div class="su-box"><p>How I got on to the platform, I have no idea; perhaps the Canadian had carried me there. But I breathed, I inhaled the vivifying sea-air. My two companions were getting drunk with the fresh particles. The other unhappy men had been so long without food, that they could not with impunity indulge in the simplest aliments that were given them. We, on the contrary, had no end to restrain ourselves; we could draw this air freely into our lungs, and it was the breeze, the breeze alone, that filled us with this keen enjoyment.</p></div></div></div><div class="su-clear"></div></div><div class="su-clear"></div><footer><div class="su-wrapper su-p0"><div class="su-box"><p>Created by <a href="http://uoziod.ru">Semyon Vyskubov</a></p><p><a href="http://github.com/uoziod/suave-ui">Suave UI</a> is inspired by <a href="https://github.com/tansky/actiguide">Actiguide</a> and licensed under MIT</p><p><a href="http://fontawesome.io/">Font Awesome</a> font is licensed under the SIL OFL 1.1</p><p><a href="http://daneden.github.io/animate.css/">Animate.css</a> is licensed under MIT</p></div></div></footer><!-- Yandex.Metrika counter --><script type="text/javascript"> (function (d, w, c) { (w[c] = w[c] || []).push(function() { try { w.yaCounter27000363 = new Ya.Metrika({ id:27000363, webvisor:true, trackHash:true }); } catch(e) { } }); var n = d.getElementsByTagName("script")[0], s = d.createElement("script"), f = function () { n.parentNode.insertBefore(s, n); }; s.type = "text/javascript"; s.async = true; s.src = (d.location.protocol == "https:" ?
